      <h3>What is numerlogy ?</h3>
      <p>Numerology is the ancient study of numbers and their mystical influence on our lives. 
          Based on your name and date of birth, numerology reveals insights about your personality, 
          life path, strengths, and future. Each number carries a unique vibration and meaning that 
          helps uncover your true potential, guide important decisions, and enhance self-awareness. 
          Whether you're exploring your destiny number, soul urge, or personality traits, numerology 
          offers a deeper understanding of who you are and the journey you're meant to follow.</p>

        <h3>What is Psychic number ?</h3>
        <p>The Psychic Number, also known as the Birth Number, is derived solely from the day 
            of your birth (for example, if you were born on the 14th, then 1 + 4 = 5, making your 
            Psychic Number 5). This number reveals your innate nature, emotional tendencies, 
            instinctive behavior, and your inner desires. It governs how you see yourself, how you 
            naturally react to situations, and what truly drives you from within. It represents your 
            mental makeup, personal preferences, and your unique way of thinking and feeling. In short, 
            it is the person you are on the inside, shaped largely by your subconscious mind and early life experiences.</p>

        <h3>What is Destiny number ?</h3>
        <p>Destiny Number, also known as the Life Path Number or Bhagyank in Vedic numerology, 
            is calculated from your entire date of birth (day + month + year, all digits added 
            together and reduced to a single digit). This number reflects your outer journey, life purpose, 
            karmic path, and the mission you 
            are meant to fulfill in this lifetime. While the Psychic Number tells you who you are, 
            the Destiny Number tells you what you are here to do. It highlights the opportunities, 
            challenges, and lessons that will appear throughout your life, and gives direction to 
            your personal and professional growth. Together, these two numbers offer a powerful insight 
            into your inner world and external life path, helping you align your personality with your 
            purpose. Understanding both can guide you in making better life choices, nurturing relationships, 
            and unlocking your full potential.</p>
